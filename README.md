## Quick Start 🔧

1. It is recommended to run the project using a local server (e.g., Python or VS Code Live Server):

   - Using Python 3 (run in the project root):

     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

   - Or use the VS Code Live Server extension for convenience.

> **Important reminder (please comply)** ⚠️
>
> **Do not open `index.html` directly via the file protocol (`file://`) in a browser.**
>
> Opening files directly may cause resource loading failures or prevent certain features (such as routing, JSON loading, or fetch requests) from working correctly. Always open the project through a local server. ✅

## Project Structure 📂

Main files and folders:

* `index.html` – Home page entry point (open via server)
* `css/`, `js/`, `img/` – Styles, scripts, and image resources
* `pages/` – Sub‑pages (e.g., `about.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`, etc.)
* `json/` – Static JSON data storage
* `README.md` – Project description (this file)

The working directory also contains backup files and utility scripts such as `split_script.py` and `autoSplitWatcher.ps1`.
